# Blackjack mini game

## Project Description

A browser-based implementation of the classic card game called Blackjack, developed using Next, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The game features a user-friendly interface where players can experience the excitement of Blackjack directly from their browser.

Players can hit, stand, and reset the game while trying to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible without going over. The game manages state using useReducer, providing a smooth and dynamic gameplay experience. The project also leverages TypeScript for type safety and Tailwind CSS for responsive and visually appealing design.

## Features

-   **Realistic Gameplay**: Fully functional Blackjack rules including player actions like hit, stand, and automatic dealer actions.
-   **Responsive UI**: Designed with Tailwind CSS to ensure the game is accessible across all device sizes.
-   **Dynamic State Management**: State managed with Reactâ€™s useReducer for efficient and scalable game logic.
-   **Clean Codebase**: Written in TypeScript to enforce strict type-checking and improve code maintainability.
-   **Customizable Interface**: UI components are modular and easily customizable, allowing for future enhancements.

## Technologies:

-   **Next.js**: Utilized for building a responsive, fast, and SEO-friendly React-based application.
-   **React**: The core library for building the game's user interface.
-   **TypeScript**: Used to add type safety and enhance code maintainability.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: Applied for efficient and responsive UI styling.
-   **useReducer Hook**: Leveraged for managing complex game state logic.
-   **ESLint & Prettier**: Ensured code quality and consistency.
